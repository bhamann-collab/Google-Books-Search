# Google-Books-Search
If you're like me and you see a book that you really want to read, you end up forgetting the name of the book, or you have too many books to read in your mind that you're not reading anything at all. This application will search for any book you want to read and you can save it later on your wish list. That way, you can track what books you want to read and your mind can be decluttered.
